		<h4>Description</h4>
		<p>This is a standard deviled egg recipe I copied off the internet.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>There's not all that much else to say</p>

		<p> </p>
		<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Eggs --> 6</li>
			<li>Mayonayse --> 1/4 Cup</li>
			<li>Vinegar --> 1 tsp</li>
			<li>Mustard -->1 tsp</li>
			<li>Salt --> 1/8 tsp</li>
			<li>Pepper --> to taste</li>
			<li>Paprika --> For Garnish</li>
		</ul>

		<p> </p>
		<h4>Steps:</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Place eggs in a single layer in a saucepan and cover with enough water that there's 1 1/2 inches of water above the eggs. Heat on high until water begins to boil, then cover, turn the heat to low, and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and leave covered for 14 minutes, then rinse under cold water continuously for 1 minute.</li>
			<li>Crack egg shells and carefully peel under cool running water. Gently dry with paper towels. Slice the eggs in half lengthwise, removing yolks to a medium bowl, and placing the whites on a serving platter. Mash the yolks into a fine crumble using a fork. Add mayonnaise, vinegar, mustard, salt, and pepper, and mix well.</li>
			<li>Evenly disperse heaping teaspoons of the yolk mixture into the egg whites. Sprinkle with paprika and serve.</li>
		</ol>
